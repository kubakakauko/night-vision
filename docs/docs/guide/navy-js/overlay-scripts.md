# Overlay Scripts

**Overlay scripts** define how your data will look on the chart.

As was described in the [Scripts](/guide/main-comp/scripts.html) chapter, each `.navy` file contains a javascript code (almost), separated by section tags.   

## Basic structure

Typical overlay looks like this:

```js
// Navy ~ 0.2-lite // (1)

[OVERLAY name=NewOverlay, ctx=Canvas, version=0.1.0] // (2)

// Overlay props
prop('color', { type: 'color', def: '#2d7b2f33' }) // (3)

// Draw call
draw(ctx) { // (4)
    const layout = $core.layout
    ctx.fillStyle = $props.color
    ctx.fillRect(0, 0, layout.width, layout.height) // (5)
}

// Legend, defined as pairs [value, color]
legend(x) => [[Math.random(), $props.color]] // (6)
```

The typical parts are:

1. NavyJS version comment
2. `OVERLAY` tag defining the meta-information
3. `prop` function call that defines new property
4. `draw` draw function, called every time data/view is changed
5. CanvasJS API call
6. A function defining the overlay behavior

## Functional Interface

An overlay behavior can be defined by **overriding** the following core functions.

### Life-cycle

```js
init() // Called when overlay is created
destroy() // Called when overlay is destroyed
```

### Drawing functions

```js
draw() // Main drawing call
drawSidebar() // Drawing call of sidebar
drawBotbar() // Drawing call of botbar
```

### Samplers / transforms  

```js
yRange() // Redefines y-range of overlay
preSampler() // Defines a sampler for precision detection algo
ohlc() // Mapping data point to OHLC value for magnets
```

### UI functions

```js
legend() // Defines legend as [value, color] pair
legendHtml() // Defines legend as a custom html  
valueTracker() // Sets price label + price line
```

### Mouse listeners

```js
mousemove() // Called on 'mousemove' event
mouseout() // Called on 'mouseout' event
mouseup() // Called on 'mouseup' event
mousedown() // Called on 'mousedown' event
click() // Called on 'click' event
```

### Keyboard listeners
```js
keyup() // Called on 'keyup' event
keydown() // Called on 'keydown' event
keypress() // Called on 'keypress' event
```

All the definitions described in [NavyJS API](/guide/api/navy-api.html).

## Environment

**Overlay Eviromenmet** is a group of variables describing the current chart state. They contain all the information needed to build an overlay.

### $core

Collection of all core elements and other variables, such as `data`, `range` and `view`. You can find all the definitions in [NavyJS API](/guide/api/navy-api.html) as well. The most common use case of `$core` is the main drawing loop:

```js
// A fragment of code from Spline.navy:
draw() {
    // ...
    ctx.beginPath()
    const layout = $core.layout
    const data = $core.data // Full dataset
    const view = $core.view // Visible view
    const idx = $props.dataIndex
    for (var i = view.i1, n = view.i2; i <= n; i++) {
        let p = data[i]
        let x = layout.ti2x(p[0], i) // Mapping functions
        let y = layout.value2y(p[idx]) // ...
        ctx.lineTo(x, y)
    }
    ctx.stroke()
}
```

### $props

Overlay props (`props` field of [OverlayObject](/guide/data-struct/overlay-object.html)). Props defined with `prop()` function can be immediately accessed through `$props` variable:

```js
prop('color', { type: 'color', def: '#2d7b2f33' })
console.log($props.color) // #2d7b2f33
```

If a property defined in the `props` field, it will be used by the script (instead of default one).

### $events

[Events](/guide/main-comp/events.html) component. Nothing less, nothing more.

### $lib

Collection of primitives & helper functions. For example a single candle can be drawn with a few calls:

```js
/* CandleDescriptor {
    x, // x-coordinate
    w, // width
    o, h, l, c, // y-coords
    green, // true/false
    src // Data point ref
}*/
$lib.candleWick(ctx, candleDescriptor, layout)
$lib.candleBody(ctx, candleDescriptor, layout)
```

## Y-range function  

Sometimes you need to define a y-range that is different from the one calculated by the library.

::: info
The default range is calculated as `[max, min]` of all visible values, extended by 15%.

![Y-Range](/y-range-2.png)

:::

You can use the auto-detected values, making some modifications:

```js
// A code snippet from Range.navy:
yRange(hi, lo) => [
    Math.max(hi, $props.upperBand),
    Math.min(lo, $props.lowerBand)
]
```

Also, you can disable the auto extension of the range:

```js
yRange() => [1, 0, false] // You'll get exactly [1.0, 0.0]
```

Another case is when the data contains values that should be excluded from the calculation process, e.g. like `volume` in Candles:

```js
// A code snippet from Candles.navy:
yRange() {
    let data = $core.hub.ovDataSubset($core.paneId, $core.id)
    let len = data.length
    var h, l, high = -Infinity, low = Infinity
    for(var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        let point = data[i]
        if (point[2] > high) high = point[2]
        if (point[3] < low) low = point[3]
    }
    return [high, low]
}
```

## Custom Legend

![Legend](/legend.png)

You can redefine this thing too! All you need is to return an array of `[value, color]` pairs:

```js
// Code from Cloud.navy
legend(x) => [[x[1], $props.color1], [x[2], $props.color2]]
```

In some cases you'll want to redefine the legend completely. Well, we have a solution for that too:

```js
// x - data point  
// prec - precision
// f - default value formatter
legendHtml(x, prec, f) => `
    <span style="color: purple">Well, hello</span>
    <span class="nvjs-ll-value">${f(x[1])}</span>
`
```

A good & complex example of `legendHtml` is [Candles](https://github.com/project-nv/night-vision/blob/main/src/scripts/candles.navy) overlay.

## Precision Samplers

We already covered the usage of this function [here](/guide/main-comp/meta-hub.html#precision-samplers). Again, `Candles` overlay is a nice example of the case when you need to exclude some values from sampling:

```js
// Code from Candles.navy
preSampler(x) => [x[1], x[4]]
```

Here we are using only open & close values, because volume values can produce a different precision.

## Mouse & keyboard events

Finally, if you need some intercativity, you can get all native mouse and keyboard events just by decrailring the corresponding functions:

```js
mousemove(event) {
    console.log(event)
}
keypress(event) {
    console.log(event)
}
```

If your overlay requires the locking of scrolling, you can toggle it by sending this event to MetaHub:

```
// Lock On
$events.emit('scroll-lock', true)

// Lock Off
$events.emit('scroll-lock', false)
```

## Static functions 

Introduced in Navy v0.2. Static functions are parsed before overlay execution and are placed inside an overlay prefab (e.g., `chart.scriptHub.prefabs.Area.static`). The primary reason for this feature is to address the glitch observed during chart start-up or reset. This glitch occurs because the layout builder function doesn't receive the `yRange` function until the `Candles` overlay is placed and executed. This results in the inclusion of the volume value. However, when defined with the `static` keyword, the `yRange` function becomes immediately available:

```js
static yRange(data) {
    // Calculate y-range using `data`
    // ...
    return [hi, lo]
}
```     

::: info
Please note that in Navy v0.2 the order of arguments for `yRange` has changed to (`data`, `hi`, `lo`)
:::

::: info
Static functions do not have access to the script execution context (e.g., $props, $core, etc)
:::

The `static` keyword also applies to `preSampler`. You can define your custom static functions if needed.
